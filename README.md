Spell-Checking system based on binary search trees, given a file containing all language words.
User is prompted to enter the sentence to check its spelling.
The words are then checked in the binary tree if it exists.

1. The word in the last node reached before decalaration that the word does not exist
2. Inorder predecessor of that node
3. Inorder successor of that node
